# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋  

I’m a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. With years of hands-on experience, I’ve worked across various domains, from backend development to cloud infrastructure, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools  
I specialize in the following technologies and tools:  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, Rust  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Django, Flask, React, Node.js, Express  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps & Cloud**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Terraform  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines, VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA  

## 🔭 Current Focus  
I’m currently diving deeper into **cloud-native development** and **microservices architecture**, exploring how to build resilient and scalable systems. I’m also experimenting with **Rust** for systems programming and **WebAssembly** for performance-critical web applications.  

## 🌱 Always Learning  
I believe in continuous improvement and staying updated with the latest trends in tech. Right now, I’m exploring:  
- **Machine Learning** with TensorFlow and PyTorch  
- **Blockchain** and decentralized applications  
- **Edge computing** and IoT
